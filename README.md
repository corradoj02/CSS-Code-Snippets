# CSS Snippet Cheatsheet

A webpage dedicated to CSS code snippets


## Usage

In an effort to practice some of the more focused CSS properties I've learned while also being able to come back and reflect on some of these properties as I may have a hard time remembering them, I will create and deploy a webpage that holds code snippets of some of these properties. 

## **The acceptance criteria for this project is as follows:**

As a user, I can view a collection of labeled CSS snippets in a responsive grid.


As a user, I can easily identify these CSS snippets by their headings.


As a user, I can highlight a code snippet by clicking on it.


As a user, I can view my application on a mobile device as well as a desktop.
